# HotelV4 — Project Documentation

## Overview

**HotelV4 (HOMI)** is a complete rebuild of the Alma Hotel Management System. It manages the full lifecycle of a multi-branch, hourly-rate hotel operation — from guest check-in to checkout, with integrated POS, shift-based cash management, kiosk self-service, housekeeping, and comprehensive reporting.

This is **not an upgrade** of V3. It is a **ground-up redesign** with a new database schema, new architecture, and new patterns — while preserving the exact same business processes Alma's staff uses daily.

---

## Why Rebuild?

**V3 worked, but it was breaking.** After 3 years of development, the system accumulated critical technical debt:

- **Reports were inaccurate** — wrong schema forced complex workarounds (forwarded deposit chain walks, hardcoded values, string-matching on remarks). The team spent a month debugging report inconsistencies.
- **Data types were wrong** — money stored as integers and strings, dates stored as strings, amounts stored as VARCHAR. SQL math was impossible.
- **Duplicate data everywhere** — same information stored in 2-3 tables (guests + checkin_details, 3 POS systems, 3 shift tables). No single source of truth.
- **No audit trail** — transactions were mutated after creation (paid_amount overwritten), transfers rewrote original charges, overrides had no tracking.
- **5 separate report tables** — new_guest_reports, check_out_guest_reports, extended_guest_reports, transferred_guest_reports, room_boy_reports — all had to stay in sync with actual data. They drifted.
- **28 documented issues** in total — see `v3-problems/V3_PROBLEMS_SOLVED.md` for the complete list.

---

## What V4 Delivers

| Goal | How |
|------|-----|
| **Accurate reports** | No separate report tables. All reports computed from core data. Every transaction has `shift_id` (required). No chain walks. |
| **Proper data types** | All money is `decimal(10,2)`. All dates are `datetime`. All hours are `integer`. |
| **Single source of truth** | One `stays` table (not guests + checkin_details). One `shifts` table (not 3). One POS system (not 3). |
| **Full audit trail** | Transactions are immutable — never update, only append. Voids create new records. Spatie Activitylog tracks every admin change with before/after values. |
| **No hardcoded values** | Every magic number (deposit amount, cleaning time, shift cutoff, kiosk timeout) is in `branch_settings` — configurable per branch. |
| **Clean architecture** | Traits for scoping, enums for types, services for business logic, observers for cache updates. Based on proven patterns from the general-pos project. |
| **Multi-branch ready** | Branch scoping via global scope trait. Staff can be deployed across branches. Superadmin sees everything. |
| **Scalable** | 35 well-designed tables replace 56+ V3 tables. 21 tables eliminated. No redundancy. |

## The Hotel Business

### What Kind of Hotel?

Alma operates **short-stay/transient hotels** — guests pay by the hour (6hrs, 12hrs, 24hrs), not by the night. Key characteristics:

- **Hourly rates** — each room has its own pricing per duration
- **24-hour operation** — guests check in/out anytime, staff work in AM/PM shifts
- **Walk-in focused** — most guests arrive without reservation
- **Kiosk self-service** — tablets in the lobby for guest check-in/out
- **Multi-branch** — Alma runs multiple hotel locations

### The Guest Journey

```
Guest arrives → Kiosk or frontdesk check-in → Pay room rate + deposit
    → Stay in room → Order food, request amenities
    → Extend stay if needed (cycle reset applies)
    → Transfer rooms if needed
    → Check out → Settle all charges → Deposit refunded
    → Room cleaned by roomboy → Available for next guest
```

### Business Rules That Drive the Design

1. **Extension Cycle Reset** — After every X hours (configurable per branch), guests must pay original rate instead of cheap extension rate. Prevents gaming the system.

2. **Deposit System** — Security deposit collected at check-in (key + remote). Can be used to pay charges during stay. Refunded at checkout if items returned.

3. **Shift-Based Cash Accountability** — Every frontdesk starts a shift with counted cash, every transaction tagged to their shift, cash reconciled at close. Shortages detected.

4. **Immutable Transactions** — Once created, never modified. Corrections use void + new charge. Full audit trail.

## Transaction System

10 transaction types, all immutable:

| Type | Purpose | Cash Effect |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `room_charge` | Check-in room rate | — |

## Getting Started (When Building)

1. Create fresh Laravel 12/13 project
2. Install packages (Filament 5, Spatie packages, Livewire 4)
3. Configure bootstrap/app.php (Laravel 12 style, no Kernel.php)
4. Set up Enums (RoomStatus, TransactionType, ShiftPeriod, etc.)
5. Set up Traits (ScopesToBranch, ModelRelations, ApiResponse)
6. Write migrations from `HOTEL_V4_COMPLETE_SCHEMA.md`
7. Create Models with relation traits and Spatie LogsActivity
8. Create Services (CheckInService, PaymentService, etc.)
9. Build Filament Admin panel (rooms, rates, users, discounts)
10. Build Livewire Frontdesk (room monitoring, guest transactions)
11. Build Kiosk API (Sanctum auth, check-in/out endpoints)
12. Build Roomboy dashboard (cleaning tasks, floor assignments)
13. Build Reports (all computed queries, no report tables)
14. Test everything against the example scenarios
